## My Projects

### [NetGPT](https://github.com/KennethGrace/NetGPT)

NetGPT is a network engineering personal assistant based on micro-serviced Natural Language Processing (NLP) for interpreting and executing commands on network devices. NetGPT is intended to be a platform for network automation engineers to build their own personal assistants for their own networks.

### [Gracious](https://github.com/Art-of-the-Living/Gracious)

Gracious is a hand-made machine-learning simulation framework capable of near instantaneous learning. This is really an experiment in machine learning and artificial intelligence based on the work of [Dr. Pentti O. Haikonen](https://www.uis.edu/sites/default/files/2023-05/HaikonenCV13.pdf).

### [Konpile](https://github.com/dyntek-services-inc/konpile)

Konpile is a simple, yet powerful, build system for compiling network configuration from structured data. Konpile is a functional tool, available now, for free, courtesy of The Dyntek Labs at [konpile.dynteklabs.com](https://konpile.dynteklabs.com).
