That was pretty tacky, huh?

I'm not really the best at anything, but I can do pretty much everything. I'm still trying to be the best at everything, but, I'll tell you what, I can see why people give up on that dream. So, if you see me poking around in your sphere of the world, give me a chance. I'm good at surprises.
