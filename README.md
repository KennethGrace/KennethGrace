## About Me

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Kenneth Grace and I'm a Senior Project Consultant at Dyntek Services Inc. But more importantly, I'm a programmer and a computer enthusiast. Here on my GitHub, you'll find my biggest passions: my personal projects. Please feel free to look around and see what I've been up to and thanks for stopping by!

## My Projects

### [NetGPT](https://github.com/KennethGrace/NetGPT)

NetGPT is a network engineering personal assistant based on micro-serviced Natural Language Processing (NLP) for interpreting and executing commands on network devices. NetGPT is intended to be a platform for network automation engineers to build their own personal assistants for their own networks.

### [Gracious](https://github.com/Art-of-the-Living/Gracious)

Gracious is a hand-made machine-learning simulation framework capable of near instantaneous learning. Using Hebbian correlative learning instead of back-propogration, Gracious can begin to recognize patterns with only a few examples. Admittedly, this project never broke 30% accuracy with it's limited implementation. This is really an experiment in machine learning and artificial intelligence based on the work of [Dr. Pentti O. Haikonen](https://www.uis.edu/sites/default/files/2023-05/HaikonenCV13.pdf).
