## My History

I'm also a big fan of video games and I've been known to dabble in game development from time to time.

I've been programming for over 10 years and I've been working in the IT industry for over 5 years.

My love of programming and computers started all the way back in elementary school when I taught myself JavaScript in order to make amateur video games. Over the following years, I would learn many languages and frameworks as I experimented with graphics programming. Eventually this focus on video games would bloom into a general love for the inner workings of computers. As a hobbyist I would tinker in operating system, driver, and micro-processor development.

After graduating high-school I received the opportunity for an internship at Dyntek Services Inc, a national technology solutions company. Over the course of only 5 years, I've worked my way into a Senior Project Consultant role. I live and work and a break neck pace and I have no intention of slowing down now.

I attended the College of Southern Nevada, the University of Nevada Las Vegas, and Western Governors University for all my classical training in C/C++, Java, Web development, SQL, Kernel development, and project management.
